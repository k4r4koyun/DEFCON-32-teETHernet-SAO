Project repo for the teETHernet SAO addon, released for DEFCON 32. It had the features below:
- ATMEGA328PB-AU as the microcontroller
- 9 side-mounted LEDs that shine through the back of the board
- 2 ethernet sockets
- Blinky animations + ability to test copper twisted-pair ethernet cables
- Small CTF that can be interacted via UART, which unlocks additional blinky modes after completion
